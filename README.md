Question: predicting if a mushroom is poisonous using synthetic data of mushrooms.

Methods: Using different classifier regression and neural network methods.

Result: Methods have 90% - 100% accuracy along with high precision and recall. This could be occuring due to different similarity of mushroom species causing data-leaking via similar data within testing and training set.

Conclusion: Regression and neural network methods very effective at identifying known mushrooms, but unknown mushrooms suhc as undiscovered species may slip through classification. Additionally with the high penalty of false-negatives these methods may not be best suited for task when factoring possible undiscovered species of mushroom.
